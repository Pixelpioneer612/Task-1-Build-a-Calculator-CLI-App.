# Task-1-Build-a-Calculator-CLI-App.
I would like to thank ELEVATE LABS to given me this oportunity. I succesfully completed my first task to build a calculater CLI app by using python. In this i used tkinter library to import files. I used vs code to run the programme and i clearly understand functions and loop concepts while doing my task.
